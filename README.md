# Stup-IDE
Stup_I.D.E. is an integrated development environment (IDE) for web programming, In other words, a software application from which the computer programmer acquires some facilities for web app development like websites, games, and others. The software was developed by Manhai-pictures and YMA groups which used both their skills to create their first software. The software offers a double view both on the editor and the result for the user, one of the advantages of the IDE.
